02.08.2011  1.12.22     NEW FEATURES:
                        - Primary application switchover support added.                                         (mvTLIClientGigE-lib, version 1.12.22.254)

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - GenICam features which are write-only can be written to now.                          (mvBlueCOUGAR-lib, version 1.12.22.254)
                        - When used with multiple displays to display multiple input channels in parallel       (wxPropView, version 1.12.22.253)
                          the update for displays receiving data absolutely in parallel could stop resulting
                          in only a single display refreshing data.
                        - Some ports of wxWidgets do not allow to have a window without a close button. When    (wxPropView, version 1.12.22.253)
                          using this button on the 'monitor image' wxPropView did crash.
                        - When a callback is fired this is handled in a thread save way now. Certain features   (wxPropView, version 1.12.22.253)
                          could cause a deadlock when a callback was registered before as GUI elements were
                          accessed outside the main thread.
                        - Updating the firmware of a GEV device sometimes did return DMR_INTERNAL_ERROR even    (mvDeviceConfigure, version 1.12.2.253)
                          if the update was successful.

                          wxPropViews property grid and then monitor feature changes in the 'Output' window.    (mvIMPACT_acquire.h)
                                                                                                                (wxPropView, version 1.12.18.250)
                        - 'mvGevInterfaceMTU' added to nodemaps of 'System-module' and 'Interface-module'.      (mvTLIClientGigE-lib, version 1.12.18.250)
                          The interface MTU also internally serves as a boundary for packet size negotiation
                          now which can help in case of a misbehaving NIC driver.

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - mvBlueFOX-202b and mvBlueFOX-202d devices did use an incorrect minimal width and      (mvBlueFOX-lib, version 1.12.18.250)

                          This later might affect applications that assume only GEV devices devices to be
                          reported by the library. Therefore an application should then check the TLTYPE value
                          carefully.

                        - Start/stop trigger mode: Previous versions did delay incoming stop trigger signals    (mvHYPERIONfg-lib, version 1.11.47.225)
                          which resulted in a reduced overall trigger frequency. Now this delay has been

                          in 'Generic' interface layout could result in certain streaming related properties
                          being read-only after opening the device even if streaming was not active.
                        - Internal conversions from ibpfMono8 to ibpfRGBx888Planar could cause crashes if the   (all shipped packages)

                          was requested) the format converter did perform a conversion based on incorrect 
                          assumptions.

23.11.2010      1.11.37 DEPRECATED API CODE:
                        - The interface layout 'Generic' has been declared deprecated. Please use 'GenICam'     (all shipped packages for GigE Vision devices)
                          instead, which offer a more flexible access to GenICam devices.

                        CHANGED BEHAVIOUR:
                        - The default interface layout became 'GenICam' if supported by the connected device.   (wxPropView, version 1.11.37.215)

                        - Added support for mvBlueFOX-MLC202bG and mvBlueFOX-MLC202bC devices.                  (mvBlueFOX-lib, version 1.11.35.213)

                        UPDATES:
                        - Further improved detection of lost device access. When the connection to a device is  (mvBlueCOUGAR-lib, version 1.11.35.213)
                          lost while streaming or after streaming has been on and is then reconnected the
                          device can either continue streaming or will report an error status during connection
                          problems.

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - Calling DSFlushQueue with 'ACQ_QUEUE_ALL_TO_INPUT' could result in buffers being      (mvTLIClientGigE-lib, version 1.11.35.213)
                          placed in the input buffer pool more then once, which could result in deadlocks
                          during cleanup.
                        - Calling 'DSStopAcquisition' with 'ACQ_STOP_FLAG_KILL' and an active filter driver     (mvTLIClientGigE-lib, version 1.11.35.213)
                          could result in a deadlock.

04.11.2010      1.11.34 NEW FEATURES:
                        - Image request control mode 'trial' implemented.                                       (mvV4L-lib, version 1.11.34.212)

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - Calling 'DSGetBufferInfo' with 'BUFFER_INFO_SIZE_FILLED' returns the correct value    (mvTLIClientGigE-lib, version 1.11.34.212)
                          in chunk mode now.
                        - Capture errors from CMOS versions of the mvBlueFOX-1xx and mvBlueFOX-M1xx when        (mvBlueFOX-lib, version 1.11.34.212)
                          switching digital I/Os during image transfer.

03.11.2010      1.11.33 NEW FEATURES:
                        - Capture into a user supplied buffer is working now.                                   (mvV4L-lib, version 1.11.33.211)

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - 'TLIMV_IFSetInterfaceParam' will be exported as all the other function under 32       (mvTLIClientGigE-lib, version 1.11.33.211)
                          Windows now. This will fix an error message being reported under 32 bit versions of
                          Windows when starting mvIPConfigure.

02.11.2010      1.11.32 NEW FEATURES:
                        - mvBlueFOX-MLC FPGA Version 0x1e: Supports I2C on IO connector                         (mvBlueFOX-lib, version 1.11.32.210)
                        - Firmware version 1.2.1.0 for mvBlueCOUGAR-X devices added.                            (all shipped packages for GigE Vision devices)
                          This firmware introduces massive changes in feature names and a lot of new features
                          like
                            - Chunkmode
                            - Extended Counter/Timer functionality
                            - New acquisition and trigger modes
                          However this firmware version is NOT fully backward compatible. If in doubt please
                          contact MATRIX VISION. Because of these changes it can also not be guaranteed that
                          older device driver will run in 'DeviceSpecific' interface layout when operated with
                          devices using a firmware version greater then 1.2.x thus updating the driver on these
                          systems is also highly recommended.
                        - Source code for mvIPConfigure added to MSI based installer                            (mvBlueCOUGAR.msi)
                                                                                                                (mvBlueCOUGAR-x64.msi)

28.10.2010      1.11.31 CHANGED BEHAVIOUR:
                        - After a PnP arrival event the digital outputs are restored to their previous state.   (mvBlueFOX-lib, version 1.11.31.209)

                        NEW FEATURES:
                        - Calculation of missed frames based on frame counter in Statistics/LostImagesCount.    (mvBlueFOX-lib, version 1.11.31.209)
                          Please note that e.g. when doing single snaps and the sensor runs in autotrigger mode
                          this will currently result in the lost image counter to increase so don't use
                          this parameter as a proof that frames have actually been missed. This depends on the
                          point of view and the application.
                        - Support for ibpfMono10 and ibpfMono16 added.                                          (mvV4L-lib, version 1.11.33.211)

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - In 'DeviceSpecific' interface layout certain advanced trigger configurations could    (mvBlueCOUGAR-lib, version 1.11.31.209)
                          result in inconsistent device updates.
                        - In 'DeviceSpecific' interface layout modifying the HW-LUT did not always update the   (mvBlueCOUGAR-lib, version 1.11.31.209)
                          camera HW.
                        - In 'GenICam' interface layout Loading settings did not always update all features.    (mvBlueCOUGAR-lib, version 1.11.31.209)

25.10.2010      1.11.30 NEW FEATURES:
                        - Support for extended chunk format added.                                              (mvBlueCOUGAR-lib, version 1.11.30.208)

                        UPDATES:
                        - Internal migration to IPP 6.1.6.                                                       (all shipped packages)

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - Devices that do not support chunk mode can be opened again.                           (mvBlueCOUGAR-lib, version 1.11.30.208)
                          (Bug introduced in 1.11.28)
                        - Certain Linux distribution could cause crashes during clean up work.                  (mvPropHandling-lib, version 1.11.30.208)
                          (Bug introduced in 1.11.16)

19.10.2010      1.11.29 CHANGED BEHAVIOUR:
                        - Packed Bayer conversion mode changed, now this mode packs the pixels and              (all shipped packages)
                          interpolates every second one.
                        
                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - User AOI works with TabXGeometry 1X8 now.                                             (mvHYPERIONfg-lib, version 1.11.29.207)
                                                                                                                (mvTITANfg-lib, version 1.11.29.207)
                        - Firmware update via mvDeviceConfigure does terminate correctly again for mvBlueCOUGAR (mvBlueCOUGAR-lib, version 1.11.29.207)
                          and mvBlueLYNX-M7 devices again.
                          (Bug introduced in 1.11.20)

14.10.2010      1.11.28 NEW FEATURES:
                        - 12 bit acquisition mode added to mvHYPERION-HD-SDI.                                   (mvHYPERIONfg-lib, version 1.11.28.206)

                        UPDATES:
                        - Enhanced chunk processing added. All chunk features will be part of the request info  (mvBlueCOUGAR-lib, version 1.11.28.206)
                          now and will reside in a sublist 'Info/ChunkData' of each request object.

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - The 64 bit Linux build of the GenICam GenTL producer did use an incorrect structure   (mvTLIClientGigE-lib, version 1.11.28.206)
                          alignment resulting in some registers returning an incorrect value when accessing
                          them via a GenApi nodemap.
                        - Fixed initializing of PulseStartConfiguration. Previous versions did program the      (mvHYPERIONfg-lib, version 1.11.28.206)
                          rotary decoder interface but not the default behaviour(trigger input signal).

08.10.2010      1.11.27 NEW FEATURES:
                        - Additional trigger delay added. Now it is possible to set also a trigger delay in     (mvHYPERIONfg-lib, version 1.11.27.205)
                          lines. The property delayAbs_usec is not affected from this new property. For working
                          with this new delay feature a mvHYPERION-CLm/CLf firmware upgrade to version 61 is 
                          required.

                        UPDATES:
                        - Improved detection of lost device access. If a device is no longer responding the     (mvTLIClientGigE-lib, version 1.11.27.205)
                          'State' property will be set to 'Absent'. When a device is responding again all       (mvBlueCOUGAR-lib, version 1.11.27.205)
                          communication channels will be re-created thus the device can be used again without
                          the need to close and re-open it.
                        - Request error handling improved, now error strings will be logged instead of error    (mvHYPERIONfg-lib, version 1.11.27.205)
                          codes.
                        - Further improved enhanced device discovery for misconfigured devices. A new detection (mvTLIClientGigE-lib, version 1.11.27.205)
                          mode has been added to mvIPConfigure. Switching it on and off enables and disables    (mvIPConfigure, version 1.11.21.199)
                          the usage of limited broadcasts for the device discovery. If a device is not visible
                          during 'normal' device discovery switching on limited broadcasts might help.

07.10.2010      1.11.26 UPDATES:
                        - Uncompressed versions of all the GenICam XML files processed will be written to       (mvBlueCOUGAR-lib, version 1.11.26.204)
                          a default directory automatically.
                        - Channel link reset improved if working with full CameraLink cameras.                  (mvHYPERION2.sys, version 2.1.21.29)

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - Potential memory corruption when changing from 'normal' operation to 'chunk' mode     (mvBlueCOUGAR-lib, version 1.11.26.204)
                          without changing the image resolution and then capturing data into a driver allocated
                          buffer that previously contained 'normal' image data.
                        - In interface layout 'dilGeneric' and 'dilGenICam' the 'ChunkModeActive' feature is    (mvBlueCOUGAR-lib, version 1.11.26.204)
                          no longer switched off automatically, when opening a device that supports the chunk
                          mode.

06.10.2010      1.11.25 NEW FEATURES:
                        - 'AcquisitionStart' trigger added. Now it is possible to control acquisition start     (mvHYPERIONfg-lib, version 1.11.25.203)
                          independent from the 'FrameStart' trigger.
                        - Trigger counter read out added for 'FrameStart' and 'AcquisitionStart' trigger.       (mvHYPERIONfg-lib, version 1.11.25.203)
                                                                                                                (mvHYPERION2.sys, version 2.1.20.28)

                        CHANGED BEHAVIOUR:
                        - Previous trigger overlap mode(restart trigger mode) must be defined until now with    (mvHYPERIONfg-lib, version 1.11.25.203)
                          'FrameStart' and 'FrameStop' trigger. This change is not compatible with older
                          versions. Now both trigger lists must hold the same trigger signal definitions to
                          enable this restart mode.

                        UPDATES:
                        - Improved device discovery introduced in version 1.11.23 does no longer take more      (mvTLIClientGigE-lib, version 1.11.25.203)
                          time. It's even faster then all previous versions now.                                (mvBlueCOUGAR-lib, version 1.11.25.203)

30.09.2010      1.11.24 NEW FEATURES:
                        - Rotary encoder interface added to the pulsestartconfiguration list.                   (mvHYPERIONfg-lib, version 1.11.24.202)
                        - Additional Bayer conversion algorithms added to support enhanced raw modes. This      (all shipped packages)
                          special line scan acquisition modes are only available for certain line scan cameras.

                        BUGS FIXED:
                        - The x64 version of the DirectShow interface could connect to devices when running     (DirectShow_acquire.ax, version 1.11.24.202)
                          the capture application with elevated access rights only on some 64-bit versions of
                          Windows.
                        - wxPropView can be compiled with wxWidgets version smaller then 2.7.1 again.           (wxPropView, version 1.11.24.202)
                        - Potential crashes at start-up when wxPropView has been compiled with wxWidgets 2.6.x  (wxPropView, version 1.11.24.202)
                          on Debian.
                        - Small memory leak when constantly opening an closing a device.                        (mvBlueCOUGAR-lib, version 1.11.24.202)

24.09.2010      1.11.23 CHANGED BEHAVIOUR:
                        - Discovery of misconfigured GEV devices improved. Now devices e.g. using a persistent  (mvTLIClientGigE-lib, version 1.11.23.201)
                          IP address connected to an adapter that resides in a different net can be discovered  (mvBlueCOUGAR-lib, version 1.11.23.201)
                          as well. However this increases the device enumeration time per adapter.
                        - Increased 'PoolSize' registry parameter from 64 MB to 256 MB for Cognex adapter.      (all shipped MSI-based packages)
                          This will fix certain timeout issues when running devices with high resolutions via
                          the mvIMPACTAcquire_Cognex_Adapter-lib. Please note that this memory is NOT 
                          automatically consumed unless truly needed.

17.09.2010      1.11.22 BUGS_FIXED:
                        - Changes from version 1.11.6 improved. Now internal multiplexer data is only           (low level mvHYPERION driver, Linux)
                          updated if it has changed. This load behaviour was changed in version 1.11.6.         (mvHYPERION.sys, version 1.0.47.49)
                        
10.09.2010      1.11.21 NEW FEATURES:
                        - Property mvIMPACT::acquire::Device::bayerConversionMode published.                    (mvIMPACT_acquire.h)
                          This will allow full access to the new Bayer conversion mode added in version 1.11.9.

                                of any of these packages can't be cleaned up completely. This in a
                                worst case could lead to a state where the device driver was not
                                working at all. Signed versions of these packages will be available
                                on request, but can't be installed on a system that had an unsigned
                                version installed in the past.

                        NEW FEATURE/CHANGED BEHAVIOUR: mvPropView only checks for overlay (DD)                  (mvPropView version 1.5.0.29)
                                when it needs it and displays a message on failure. DirectDraw

                        NEW FEATURE: A wxWidgets based version of mvPropView has been added to
                                the setup. It has some nice features(live histogram, line
                                profile) and a Linux version is available as well. However it's
                                display performance is weaker then the MFC based mvPropView, which
                                is the reason, why no short cut will be created on the desktop.
                                However the higher CPU load is ONLY caused by the applications
                                way of displaying the images and has nothing to do with the
                                performance of the interface itself. It can be found in the
                                'bin' folder of the installation.

16.02.2006      1.4.5   UPDATE: Internally the C++ interface now uses the class 'ExceptionFactory'
                                to create exceptions.

                        BUGFIX: long time integration sometimes produced incorrect images.                      (mvBlueFOX-lib version 1.4.5.24)

                                supported. New applications should us the sfFile flag. This also 
                                allows to do file output AND native output with a single function
                                call (by combining(sfNative | sfFile)).

                        NEW BEHAVIOUR: ::size_type return types changed to unsigned int (reason:
                                .NET support).

                        NEW BEHAVIOUR: std::map and std::set dependencies removed from C++ wrapper
                                FunctionInterface::getAvaiableSettings now returns a string
                                vector instead of a string set(reason: .NET support).

31.05.2005      1.3.0   NEW BEHAVIOUR: The underlying C-API has been moved completely to the                    (mvDeviceManager-lib 1.3.0.6)
                                mvDeviceManager-lib. Applications compiled with and older version
                                of this interface MUST be recompiled, relinked and maybe modified.
                                See the corresponding 'Porting existing code' section for details.
                                This allows to use the supported devices from other programming
                                languages (such as Visual Basic or Delphi) as well.

                        BUGFIX: mvi_acquire.h has been adapted to work with the compiler bugs
                                of the Visual Studio 6.x compiler.

                        NEW FEATURE: The setup has been reorganized. There are now workspaces
                                for Visual Studio 6.x, 7.x and Borland C++ Builder 6.x for all
                                Sample programs.

                        NEW SAMPLE: ContinuousCapture_C shows how to work with the 'C' compliant

                        NEW BEHAVIOUR: It's no longer necessary to link mvPropHandling.lib.                     (mvDeviceManager-lib 1.3.0.6)
                                Only mvDeviceManager.lib is needed now.

                        UPDATE: Bayer conversion speed optimised for mvBlueFOX devices.                         (mvBlueFOX-lib 1.3.0.7)

                        BUGFIX: mvBlueFOX 121 with 40MHz pixel clock is now working properly.                   (mvBlueFOX-lib 1.3.0.7)

                        1.2.2 NEW FEATURE: Hibernating support added for mvBlueFOX devices.                     (mvBlueFOX-lib version 1.2.2.6)

                        NEW BEHAVIOUR: Searching devices is now down in the mvDeviceManager-lib.                (mvDeviceManager-lib version 1.2.2.6)
                                This will require an up to date mvDeviceManager-lib on each
                                target system compiled with the actual version of the mvi_acquire.h!

                        NEW BEHAVIOUR: Device::setID and Device::updateFirmware now call direct                 (mvDeviceManager-lib version 1.2.2.6)
                                exports of the mvDeviceManager-lib.
                                This will require an up to date mvDeviceManager-lib on each
                                target system compiled with the actual version of the mvi_acquire.h!

                        NEW BEHAVIOUR: matchString function removed!

                        NEW FEATURE: AGC and AEC are available under mvPropView now.                            (mvBlueFOX-lib version 1.2.1.5)

                        NEW FEATURE: MirrorMode property (allows horizontal or vertical flipping                (mvBlueFOX-lib version 1.2.1.5)
                                of the image. See ImageProcessing::MirrorMode.

                        NEW FEATURE: User controlled firmware update, EEPROM stored device ID.                  (mvBlueFOX-lib version 1.2.1.5)
                                See Device::setID(), Device::updateFirmware(), Device::HWUpdateResult.

20.04.2005      1.2.0   NEW FUNCTION Property::readSArray.                                                      (mvPropHandling-lib version 1.2.0.4)

                        NEW BEHAVIOUR: FunctionInterface::createSetting and 
                                FunctionInterface::createImageRequestControl don't throw exceptions
                                anymore, but return an error code if the call failed. 

                        BUGFIX: An error is reported, if XML-settings can't be located.                         (mvPropHandling-lib version 1.2.0.4)

                        UPDATE: C++ wrapper header structure reorganized. Now there is only one header
                                ( mvi_acquire.h ).

                        NEW BEHAVIOUR: Certain things in the interface have been changed. Some
                                will force you to recompile your application, some will
                                even force you to modify existing code. We are still in the 
                                beta stadium, but we are getting closer to a stable interface.
                                Some exported function modified or removed from mvPropHandling.h

                        BUGFIX: Destroying a DeviceManager object doesn't leave invalid windows                 (mvDeviceManager-lib version 1.2.0.4)

                        BUGFIX: Various minor fixes...

11.03.2005      1.1.1   NEW BEHAVIOUR: In mvPropHandlingDataTypes.h the unsigned int constants                  (mvPropHandling-lib version 1.1.0.2)
                                for defining the operation mode of search functions have been
                                renamed to avoid confusion with the TStorageFlag type. The leading
                                'sf' has been renamed to 'sm'. The constant 'sfSearchSublists' has
                                been removed, as the underlying behaviour can be expressed by the
                                maximum search depth as well. This is an incompatible change which 
                                might force you to modify existing source.

                        NEW FEATURE: New TStorageFlag added: sfProcessInheritance.                              (mvPropHandling-lib version 1.1.0.2)

                        BUGFIX: Deadlock removed when multiple threads accessed the property                    (mvPropHandling-lib version 1.1.0.2)
                                module.

                        DOCUMENTATION UPDATED

                        NEW FEATURE: New sample program added (ContinuousCaptureAllDevices), to 
                                demonstrate how to access all supported devices found in the 
                                current system in a single application.

                        BUGFIX: PropertyS::read function caused an access violation when building
                                the result string when a NULL-pointer was returned by the function.

                        BUGFIX: Noisy images for certain sensor types of the mvBlueFOX.                         (mvBlueFOX-lib version 1.0.2.3)

                        BUGFIX: Wrong colours in Bayer converted images for 1024*768 sensor.                    (mvBlueFOX-lib version 1.0.2.3)
