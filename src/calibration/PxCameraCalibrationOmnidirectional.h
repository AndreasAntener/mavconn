/**
 * @brief The calibration data wrapper classes for omnidirectional cameras.
 *
 * PxCameraCalibrationOmnidirectional loads calibration data for omnidirectional
 * cameras and offers functions to undistort images and points.
 *
 * One speciality of omnidirectional calibration is that there is no K matrix
 * inherently defined. One has to chose an focal length for a virtual camera and
 * then all points are undistorted accordingly.
 *
 * \code
 *         focal   0    center_x
 * K    =    0   focal  center_y
 *           0     0       1
 *
 *         1/focal   0     center_x/focal
 * K^-1 =     0    1/focal center_y/focal
 *            0      0           1
 * \endcode
 *
 * The camera center for the undistorted image is chosen to be the center of the
 * image size which was used during the calibration.
