MAVCONN - MICRO AIR VEHICLE MIDDLEWARE

MAVConn is optimized for low-latency, high-speed communication. It scales from
miniature platforms like an OMAP3530-driven Gumstix Overo to an Intel Core 2 DUO 1.86 GHz
single board computer. In can run on Ubuntu Linux, OpenEmbedded and Mac OS X.

MAVConn is using LCM as primary communication channel, with MAVLink as message
format. This allows to directly interface MAVConn to autopilot and inertial
measurement units. MAVConn can be connected via UDP/Wifi or a radio modem to
the QGroundControl Operator Control Unit.

Building MAVConn is quick and easy, only very few external libraries are needed.
